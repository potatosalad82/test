        <p>
			End_Game here I swear that Jim is working here on his own free will so no need to feel too bad for him. Honestly we might treat
			him badly but we are kind compared to the way many people treat their interns. It's rough being an intern. Glad I am not one.
        </p>
        <p>
			Jim is actually my best friend wait what the hell are you doing how could you write such scandals things. 
			flkj;wajkrtwel;kjr;lsfj Sorry that was Jim messing around was it worth it Jim. Was it worth getting your face shoved into the
			dirty keyboard. Anyway please donate for the safety of Jim.

			I legit haven't met this guy yet so I cant tell you much about him.  He told me something about saying how hes the manager and that he handles 
			some of the content here, but doesn't everyone?  Also he's responsible for managing my shifts and payments, so I guess I can blame him on the
			fact I work 16 hours per day.Also I have not been paid in six weeks send help - Jim the Intern
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Oh no, I apologize for Jim's outbreak.  Let me clear this up.  We pay Jim <i>a fair salary</i> and he <i>never</i> works more than 40 hours per week, 
			I swear.

        <p>
			Hello Margaret here nice to meetcha End_Game was kind enough to set up some fancy talky device that he says will type for
			me. I absolutely refuse to touch computers because I don't want to catch a computer virus. My son recently got me a new fangled
			flip phone gosh technology these days so crazy. In my day we had our phones attached to the wall. Anyway... ooo 10 ways to rock
			hard abs don't mind if I do... ERROR 404
        </p>
        <p>
			End_Game here while Margaret doesn't know the first thing about tech we love her she is the best at keeping the loan sharks
			at bay. Even if we do have to wipe our system occasionally or frequently. Margaret drew her pic herself.
