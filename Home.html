			<h2>New Updates</h2>
		<p>
			We are still accepting games to add to the website. If you would like to contribute a game and get your name out there, please
		  follow the directions on our contact page. Our goal is to hit at least 100 games and 100 members by the end of this year.
		  We are currently working on a free membership status with perks as a thanks to anyone who visits this website. Please recommend 
		  this website to your friends so they can get in on the ground floor of innovative new games.

	  <h4>Please check out our "news" page for upcoming developments...</h4>
	  <h2>Quick Intro to GamePortals.com</h2>
	  <p>
			We are a small student-led project put out by Potato Industries with the goal of sharing games with everyone. This is
			starting as a class project and we hope that it will grow into something more. We want games created by anyone big and small to be
			seen by the world so we want to create a database of all types of games. Anyone who follows the instructions on our home page and 
			sends us a game will see it put up on the website with a bio to give them credit and publicity. If you want to play a game go to 
			our games page and browse our ever growing library. *Catergories and other organization hopefully coming soon* If you don't have a 
			game in mind try our random game page and you'll be sent a random game from our library. Also we are looking for help. We can't pay much
			but if this becomes big we will definitely hook you up. Anyone who has any experience in coding is welcome especially those with 
			experience in HTML and other web development.
