				<h2>Quick intro to GamePortals.com</h2>
				
					<p>
						We are a small student project put out by Potato Industries with the goal of sharing games with 
						everyone. This is starting as a class project but we hope that it will grow into something more. We want to create 
						a database of games not associated with a particular developer for gamers who want to try something new and different.
						So, if you want to try something new or want to post your game and get feedback we're here for you. 
						To post your game follow the instructions on our homepage and send us a game.  We will put it up with your bio. 
						If you want to play a game go to our games page and browse our ever growing 
						library. *Catergories and other organization hopefully coming soon* If you don't have a game in mind try our "random
						game page" to be sent a random game from our library. Also, we are looking for help.  
						Anyone who has any experience in coding is welcome, especially those with 
						experience in HTML and web developement.
					</p>
				<h2>New Updates</h2>
					<h4>7-4-18</h4>
						<p>
							So we were going to a big update next month but all of our schools went on summer break and we lack the time and modivation to work
							on that update as of now so as a compermise we will be releasing an update of a bunch of new games instead and will delay the big update
							until further notice so please wait another month for that update and enjoy these new games until then and please donate and send us new 
							games. We know as of now this website is mostly a ghoast town but the few that travel to this site thank you and please tell your friends.

					<h4>5-25-18</h4>
							<p>
								1.0.1 came and this is a big one. We revamped the website entirely ESPECIALLY THAT F@#$ING SPACE BETWEEN THE MENU AND HEADER.
								We finally got some games uploaded. If you send a game in now, well good news we now have a staff of 2 so we will try to 
								update every month if not a couple games per week. we will start to work on the next update which we have "leaked" 
								information about in the new updates tab tab so check it out. And finally we will create a staff page because now we have 
								doubled	in size lol. Anyway 2 + 2 = 5 guys. WELCOME UPDATE 1.0.1 WHOO HOOO!

							Again sorry for the time inbetween posts anyway End_Game says that we need to finsh this weekend because since this 
							is also a school project and it is time for it to get graded. So our update is going to be released in 4 hours and 
							we will be officially online so finally welcome to our page people. If you look on our next update page it will now 
							reveal our secret plans for our next update 1.0.2. Until then it is gonna get crazy we bought 300 redbulls and 3 monsters
							because only Jim (le me) likes monster and nobody likes Jim. :( We really need donations so just one dollar would mean so much.
							Yesterday End_Game started crying with joy when he found a penny on the street. When we got back to the office he squatted on 
							his desk chair and whispered precious my precious yess for hours like a fat sweaty gollum. So please, please, please donate and 
							so we can buy some more caffeine.

				<h4>5-15-18</h4>
						<p>
							So sorry for the long break in updates when we are getting so close to our deadline. Our CEO has written a small
							monologue to about our absence here it is: His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. There's vomit on 
							his sweater already, mom's spaghetti... nope nevermind looks like he qouted Eminem. Well, as a hardworking 
							underling to this awful CEO I will explain. The CEO, who despite his constant whining will not be called the 
							great Emporer of Games or the Game master or worst of all your moms latest vistor * note the last one was 
							censored from booty#$@@*. Anyway since our CEO End_Game is so useless I will be writing this latest update.
							First change is these "daily" updates will now be done by all the employees who will of course have fun with it 
							so bear with me and they will sign them as a type of work log to introduce what they are working on. Behind the
							scenes we have created a doc with a long list of ideas and tasks and overall maintenance that we now just pick 
							aa item off and complete. We want to add an update each time we complete one to help our teacher grade
							this and to write our life story too. We will be also creating a youtube channel where we all play games and 
							hate on our new intern jim *le me* keep a look out for news on that soon. Our next update will be out in ten 
							days and so far no one has done anything but fart. * remind me to get a gas mask to keep at the office. End_Game
							claims to be working on a template for our first couple games but who knows. Anyway jim out peace * I was told 
							that only cool kids get a nickname*

					<h4>4-25-18</h4>
						<p>
							We are going to create a couple of new stylesheets for diffrent pages. The original stylesheet is good but it
							will only really be used for the news page and maybe the next update page and home page. The about page will get a 
							unique background and layout to make it a nice place to show off our growing staff. We doubled in size this month lol
							hey 1 x 2 = 2 This will probably entail more of a small bio page of like 4 columns and its own lighter background but
							it will of course still keep the heading and menu that will be on all of our pages. The contact page will have forms
							built in to interact with so you can send your email and game from the page itself. It will also contain the 
							instructions for how to submit a game and all. The game pages will be a window in the center for the game and the 
							authors bio on the sides as well as a list of their other games. Underneath we will try to add a comment 
							section. Finally we will be adding more pages.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some more random things that wil be added will be a account system so that we can now have user profiles. Now you
							can look forward to later updates including things that will personlize the website per user. Artists will get
							a unique account that users can follow and leave reviews on and get new games that they release as well as their
							own news log for whatever they want to say. You can watch your favorite artist grow and become more popular. This
							is going to suck and take us weeks of grinding our fingers and keys so please tell your friends to check us out
							so that our pain will be worth it. We will get the menu to stay at the top no matter how far you scroll. We will
							be adding catergoires to organize our ever growing game libray and last but not least we will be making a bunch 
							of other changes we haven't even decided to do yet.
						</p>
					<h4>4-19-18</h4>
						<p>
							Our next update will be one of the biggest ever. It will also be our last update before going fully active so get 
							ready. Anyway we plan on finally changing the whole layout of the website starting with the bakground. These first
							couple updates are merely a way of organizing the team so we have a written plan and for the hardcore fans who want
							to see the begining of the journey. So the first change is the background. We are going to completly change it, crazy
							right. The original image we picked is a mess. It is all over the place and after hours of attempted fixes we said
							to hell with it and decided to get a new one. Next we are finally going to throw out that ugly gray bakground color
							and freshen up this page with a kool new color. Though as we write this we still have no idea what it should be but
							that gray is not working. :| it ugly. After that we are going to choose a new font because it is like the gray 
							problem but almost worse because it makes the gray look much worse. We are even going to change the text color maybe
							even to glowing red. 
						</p>
					<h4>4-16-18</h4>
						<p>
							Our next update will be coming and this is a big one. We will be revamping the website entirely ESPECIALLY THAT 
							F@#$ING SPACE BETWEEN THE MENU AND HEADER. We will finally get some games we hope and upload any games sent to us 
							at least 10 days before the update. If you send a game in after that, well good news! We now have a staff of 2 so we
							will try to update every month if not a couple games per week. We will start to work on the next update which we 
							have "leaked" information about in the news tab so check it out. And finally we will create a staff page because 
							now we have doubled in size lol. Anyway 2 + 2 = 5 guys. WELCOME UPDATE 1.0.1 WHOO HOOO

					<h4>4-15-18</h4>
						<p>
						  So far we are still accepting games to add to this website. If you would like to contribute a game and get your name 
						  out there please follow the directions on our contact page. Our goal is to hit at least 100 games and 100
						  members by the end of this year. Right now this is still a class project so we here at Potato Industries lack the 
						  skills to create a membership status but we hope to have a free membership status with perks as a thanks to anyone 
						  who visits the website. Please recomend this website to your friends so they can experience the freshest and most innovative games.
